# Expense Tracking

This program scans the gmail and captures the different labels depending on what category the email is labeled for.
Emails that can be scanned and automated are:

- PayLah!
- ibanking.alert@DBS

However, this program is not able to detect incoming payments from others as it is still an ongoing project.
It makes use of different APIs such as google and AWS DynamoDB.

I will not be going in depth on how to set up the google account and AWS DynamoDB as it is only for personal purposes and not for commercial use.

Remember to create credential.json, you can get the credentials from the google workspace OAuth 2.0 Client ID
